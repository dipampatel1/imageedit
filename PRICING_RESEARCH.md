## Current Pricing Issues

Your current model:

- **Tier 2**: $39/month - 10,000 images ❌ (too expensive)
- **Tier 3**: $89/month - 50,000 images ❌ (too expensive)

**Problems:**
1. Tier 2 at $39/month is more expensive than Midjourney Pro ($60) but offers less value
2. Most competitors offer unlimited or much higher limits for similar/lower prices
3. The gap between free (10) and paid tiers is too large
4. No middle ground for casual users

## Recommended: Option 1 (Value-Focused)

**Why this works:**
1. **Competitive with Midjourney**: $9.99 Starter vs $10 Basic (200 images)
2. **Better value than Canva**: More images for similar price
3. **Clear progression**: Free → Starter → Pro → Business
4. **Annual discounts**: 17% encourages longer commitments
5. **Reasonable limits**: Not too restrictive, not too generous
6. **Commercial license at Pro**: Important for professional users

## Overage Pricing (After Monthly Limit)

If users exceed their monthly limit:
- **Starter**: $0.10 per additional image
- **Pro**: $0.05 per additional image  
- **Business**: $0.03 per additional image

This encourages upgrades while allowing flexibility.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Free tier should be generous enough** to attract users but limited enough to encourage upgrades
2. **Starter tier should be the "sweet spot"** for most individual users
3. **Pro tier should target professionals** who need commercial rights
4. **Business tier should target teams/agencies** with higher volume needs
5. **Annual discounts** (15-20%) improve cash flow and retention
6. **Overage pricing** should be reasonable but encourage plan upgrades

## Market Positioning

Position as:
- **More affordable than Midjourney Pro** ($24.99 vs $60)
- **More generous than Canva** (200 vs 500, but better features)
- **Better value than pay-per-use** for regular users
- **Professional features** at accessible prices
